/**
 * One live speaking exam: browser <-> this bridge <-> OpenAI Realtime.
 *
 * The bridge is a generic segment runner. The client sends an ordered list of
 * segments (built in src/lib/speakingExamSegments.ts) and the bridge walks them,
 * deciding when the examiner may move on. The model never advances the script by
 * itself — it will happily invent a candidate answer during dead air and try to
 * continue, so only genuinely transcribed speech counts as an answer.
